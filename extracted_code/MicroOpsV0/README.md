MicroOps ERP

This repository contains a simplified, offline-first ERP system implemented as a single-page
application. It is intended to be run locally by opening index.html. The current
implementation has been updated according to the supplied specification (MICROOPS_SPEC.md).

1. Summary of This Update

This release finalizes the core ERP loops, specifically Production Completion and Document Generation.

Production Completion: Added logic to the Production module to "Complete" an order. This action now:

Adds the finished product quantity to stock.

deducts the component quantities (BOM) from stock.

Creates corresponding 'consumption' and 'production' records in the Stock Movements log.

Updates the Production Order status to 'completed'.

Document Generation (LS/RE): The Documents module is now fully operational.

Users can generate Delivery Notes (Lieferschein) and Invoices (Rechnung) directly from Confirmed Orders.

The "View/Print" action now generates a clean, professional A4 HTML layout suitable for printing to PDF, including company headers, address blocks, item tables, and totals.

Reporting: The Reports page is no longer a placeholder. It now provides CSV exports for:

Orders Masterlist

Delivery Log

Production Summary

Inventory Valuation

Orders Integration: The "Generate" buttons on the Orders page are now wired to the new Documents logic.

Pricing: Added CSV export for price lists.

2. Fully Working Modules

Dashboard: KPI cards fully functional.

Customers (Stammdaten): Full CRUD.

Artikelstamm (Products): Full CRUD + Stock.

Inventory (Materialliste): View + Manual Stock Adjust.

Components (E‑Komponenten): Full CRUD + usage in Production.

Suppliers & Carriers: Full CRUD.

Orders (Masterliste Auftrag): Create, pricing, save, export CSV.

Tasks / Planner: Full CRUD.

Settings: Company settings + Theme/Lang.

Production Orders: Create PO, Define BOM per PO, Complete PO (consumes stock/adds product).

Documents: Generate from Order, View/Print A4 HTML.

Reports: CSV Exports for key entities.

3. Partially Implemented Modules

Price Lists: Create/Export works. Editing individual line items inside the list is still restricted to auto-generation logic (based on product defaults) rather than manual line-by-line overrides.

Stock Movements: Tracks movements correctly. Advanced filtering UI is basic.

4. Not Yet Implemented

User/Role Management: Basic seed data exists, but UI to add/remove users is limited to the Settings list view (read-only view currently).

Complex BOM Management: BOMs are currently defined "per production order" or assumed. A dedicated "BOM Master" screen on the Product page is a potential future enhancement.

5. Known Issues

Modal forms don't have deep validation (e.g. preventing negative stock if consumption exceeds inventory).

"Manual" document creation is stubbed; currently documents must be generated from Orders to ensure data integrity.

6. QA Notes

Documents & Printing

Tested "Generate Invoice" from Order A2025-0075.

Verified "View" opens a new window with A4 styling.

Verified "Print" button in that window triggers browser print dialog.

Production Flow

Created PO for 10 units.

Added 2 components (Bottle, Cap).

Clicked "Complete".

Verified Product stock increased +10.

Verified Component stock decreased.

Verified 3 new rows in "Stock Movements" (1 production, 2 consumption).
